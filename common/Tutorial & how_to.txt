1. Run _p_main_menu.py

     Double click A000001-001
     Double click A000001-001.xls

    Status of the selection should appear on line 'Step 1 select a contract:' above the next menu

3. Run "3. step_3__select_fields_to_print_for_each_template_选择每种标签类型的资料": Enter 3 Return
    If ~~~ Now working on template: is not 'a.Outer_box_外箱', then enter 0 Return and select it
    a. Check if the desired field is already in the "~~~ Specific fields selected so far" list, then there is nothing more to do

    b. Check if it appears in the matrix of fields to be selected from for example 'plstc_bg', then:
    'e. edit_a_template'  e Return
    '2. edit_fields' 2 Return
    "'a' to add a field' a Return
    Enter corresponding # for the field to be added, Return
    'b' to go back
    Verify that 'plstc_bg' is in the list of selected fields to far

    c. If the desired field does not appear in the matrix, for example a field 'color_zh' that would capt the '颜色' info
    Copy all contract's contents from the file .../data/A000001-001/.p1a_A000001-001-contract.txt into
          the https://regex101.com  TEST STRING box

    In regex101.com check Flavor as Python  (Python should appear as bold characters and followed by a check sign)

    In regular expression, text that \w颜色 has 8 matches (the number of products)
           and that \w(?=颜色) matches 8 times with the color data needed for the field

    In .../data/regular_expression.json, add a line formatted as:
     { "what": "color_zh", "how": "\\w(?=颜色)"}
    DO MIND the \\ instead of the unique \ in regex101.com
    If this line is the last one, there should not be a comma at the end

    Back in _p_main_menu, run '5. process_selected_contract'
    Go to '3. step_3__select_fields_to_print_for_each_template_选择每种标签类型的资料", check that the matrix has now a field 'color_zh'
    Process as in 3.b precedently


4. In the .../data/A000001-001/a.Outer_box_外箱 directory, open the label_template.svg file with inkscape
   Create a text field that will include ${plstc_bg}
   Save

5. In menu ~~~ Step 3: ...     check that the label now includes data from the newly added field:
    1 Return , to check the first product prints correctly
    2 Return ,  to check all products print correctly
